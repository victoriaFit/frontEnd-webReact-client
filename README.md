# How to run the project
To run this React project, follow the steps below:

## 1. Install the project dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## 2. Set up OpenAI API Key
Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create a `.env` file in the project directory. Add the following line, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
**Note**: You will need to set up a payment method on the OpenAI Platform, even for free usage, to make the API key work. A $5 charge will be temporary, and you will receive a refund later.
